# About

A small react app I made for checking prices of goods across multiple servers in Final Fantasy XIV. Still very much so a wip. Mainly to save needing to open multiple tabs in universalis. The goal would be to get options on which servers to go for to either get all the cheapest or cheapest with only a few server hops.

# Install

Pull and npm install + npm start. No backend or anything here just pulls from the universalis api.

# Note

Last I checked the api I used to translate the item name into item ids was not working so this may or may not work.
