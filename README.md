# About

A small react app I made for checking prices of goods across multiple servers in Final Fantasy XIV. Still very much so a wip. Mainly to save needing to open multiple tabs in universalis. The goal would be to get options on which servers to go for to either get all the cheapest or cheapest with only a few server hops.

# Install

Pull and npm install + npm run dev. No backend or anything here just pulls from the universalis and XIVAPI apis.

# Note

Using XIVAPI beta so it may at some point in the future just stop working. The functionality is still not fully reworked and so it fetches prices but shows nothing just yet.
